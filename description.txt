Undertale Gameover adds the Undertale Gameover screen to Terraria, On death, your SOUL shatters and Asgore will inspire you to stay determined! Works with Multiplayer!   

BONUS: There's a small chance to get a special gameover animation, inspired by a font-named character, when you are killed by certain enemies! DM me for hints!

-----------------------------------------
!IMPORTANT!
If you're playing a mod (eg Calamity) which shortens the respawn time please read:

There's a toggle in the config to support shorter respawn times. This limits the animation to only the SOUL shattering (3 seconds). Undertale Gameover is compatible with short respawn times, but some may find it inconvient as the animation duration is same as vanilla respawn time.
