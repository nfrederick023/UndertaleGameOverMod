Adds the "Undertale" Gameover to Terraria.

On death, your SOUL shatters. Asgore will inspire you to stay determined! Be wary though, there's a small chance that certain enemies will tell you to get dunked on!

If you're using Calamity, or a similar mod, which shortens the respawn timer, there's a toggle in the config to support short respawn times. This reduces the animation to only the SOUL shattering (3 seconds).
