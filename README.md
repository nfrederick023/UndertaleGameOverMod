**Undertale Gameover** adds the Undertale Gameover screen to Terraria, On death, your SOUL shatters and Asgore will inspire you to stay determined! Works with Multiplayer!

BONUS: There is a small chance to get a special gameover animation, inspired by a font-named character, when you are killed by certain enemies! DM me for hints!

**IMPORTANT**
-----------------------------------------
If you are playing a mod (eg Calamity) which shortens the respawn time please read:

There is a toggle in the config to support shorter respawn times. This limits the animation to only the SOUL shattering (3 seconds). Undertale Gameover is compatible with short respawn times, but some may find it inconvient as the animation duration is same as vanilla respawn time.
